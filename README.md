# Fraudulent Card Transaction Classifier

The "Fraudulent Card Transaction Classifier" is a machine learning project focused on the critical issue of financial security. Our objective is to develop a robust model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. We've leveraged and benchmarked several algorithms and techniques such as Random Under Sampling (RUS), Random Over Sampling (ROS), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve our model's predictive power.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry, leading to significant monetary losses every year. Traditional fraud detection systems often struggle to keep pace with the sophistication of fraudulent tactics. This project aims to use machine learning to enhance the detection of such activities and reduce the rate of false negatives.

## Algorithms Used

We have explored several algorithms and resampling techniques to handle the imbalanced dataset that is typical of fraud detection:

- **Random Under Sampling (RUS)**: This method reduces the number of majority class instances to balance the dataset.
- **Random Over Sampling (ROS)**: This technique involves replicating the minority class instances to balance the dataset.
- **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**: This approach generates synthetic instances of the minority class to balance the dataset.

These methods are evaluated and compared to select the most effective approach for our classification model.
